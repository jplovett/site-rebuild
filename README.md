# site-rebuild

project built from the template-site repo, using node/parcel/bootstrap/sass.

It is a drop in and go web SPA site template set up to serve views on nav/button click and on start. Views consist of 1 or more full width sections (bootstrap flex row with wrap) which contain 1 or more snippets/componenets (in bootstrap cols). And with sass bootstrap theme/color overrides to give you full control.
